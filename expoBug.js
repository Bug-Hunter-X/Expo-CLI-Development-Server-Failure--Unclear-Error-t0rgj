While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server wouldn't start, returning an error message that didn't provide a clear cause.  The error was generic, and I tried common solutions like checking ports, restarting the machine, and reinstalling Node modules. Nothing resolved the problem.  I also confirmed that the project's dependencies were correctly installed.
